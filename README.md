# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry.  
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave the service)** using machine learning techniques.

The goal of this project is to help telecom companies **identify at-risk customers early** and take preventive actions to improve customer retention.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Telecom companies lose revenue when customers discontinue their services.  
By analyzing customer usage patterns and service details, we can build a model that predicts **customer churn** and supports better business decisions.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses telecom customer data containing information such as:
- Customer demographics
- Usage patterns
- Subscription details
- Customer support interactions

**Files used:**
- `telecom_churn_data.csv` – Raw dataset  
- `preprocessed_data_churn.csv` – Cleaned and preprocessed dataset

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data analysis
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Streamlit** – Web application deployment

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train–test split
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Model evaluation using accuracy and other metrics

**Achieved Accuracy:** ~85%

---

## 🚀 Application
A user-friendly web application is built using **Streamlit**, where users can:
- Enter customer details
- Get real-time churn prediction
- Understand whether a customer is likely to churn or not
